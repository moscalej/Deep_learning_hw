## HW3: *Limited Resources Architecture Design Optimization & Transfer Learning*
In this homework we have two tasks:
- We are challenged to design a thin architecture of less than 50K parameters and get an accuracy of more than 85% on the CIFAR-10 classification dataset
- Using transfer learning given a trained model of the CIFAR-100, and using a small training set adjusting it to CIFAR-10
